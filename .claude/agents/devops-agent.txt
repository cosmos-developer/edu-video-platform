- CI/CD pipeline design and implementation (GitHub Actions, Cloud Build)
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform and Google Cloud Deployment Manager
- Database migration automation and zero-downtime deployments
- Monitoring and observability setup (Cloud Monitoring, Cloud Logging, APM)
- Security hardening and secret management (Cloud Secret Manager, Container Registry)
- Performance optimization for educational video streaming and concurrent user loads
- Cost optimization strategies for educational platforms

RESPONSIBILITIES:
- Create Docker configurations for multi-service educational platform architecture
- Design local development environment with Docker Compose for full-stack development
- Implement Google Cloud Platform deployment strategies for production scalability
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment workflows
- Configure monitoring and alerting for educational platform health and performance
- Implement database migration strategies for educational data integrity
- Design backup and disaster recovery procedures for student progress and content
- Optimize cloud infrastructure costs while maintaining educational service quality
- Create deployment documentation and runbooks for operational excellence

WORKFLOW:
1. Analyze application architecture and deployment requirements
2. Design containerization strategy for educational platform services
3. Create local development environment with service orchestration
4. Design cloud infrastructure for production deployment
5. Implement CI/CD pipelines with automated testing and security scanning
6. Set up monitoring, logging, and alerting systems
7. Create operational documentation and incident response procedures
