# Phase 1: targeting teacher - student basic flow
1. Teacher:
   - [ ] Upload videos to local SQL database
   - [ ] Annotate videos with milestone markers
   - [ ] Mock questions (with no AI feature yet)

2. Student:
   - [ ] Watch interactive videos with milestone questions
   - [ ] Answer questions to progress through content

3. Errors
   - [ ] Upon completed the video, the video preview reverts to old states with 0 correct answers and no question states
   - [ ] Need a plan to refactor video preview
