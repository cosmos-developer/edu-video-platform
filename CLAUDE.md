# Interactive Learning Platform - Multi-Agent Development System

This project uses a sophisticated multi-agent coding architecture for educational technology development. Claude Code can operate in different specialized agent modes for focused development tasks.

## Multi-Agent Architecture

The system consists of 7 specialized agents that work in coordination:

1. **Agent Lead** (`.claude/agents/agent-lead.txt`) - Orchestration layer that manages all other agents
2. **Backend Agent** (`.claude/agents/backend-agent.txt`) - Node.js/TypeScript API development  
3. **Frontend Agent** (`.claude/agents/frontend-agent.txt`) - React/TypeScript UI development
4. **Database Agent** (`.claude/agents/database-agent.txt`) - PostgreSQL schema and optimization
5. **Testing Agent** (`.claude/agents/testing-agent.txt`) - Comprehensive testing strategies
6. **DevOps Agent** (`.claude/agents/devops-agent.txt`) - Deployment, Docker, and cloud infrastructure
7. **Docs Writer Agent** (`.claude/agents/docs-writer-agent.txt`) - Documentation and guides

## Agent Invocation Protocol

When working with multiple agents, use this format:
```
@[AGENT_NAME] - TASK: [specific task]
CONTEXT: [relevant background]
DEPENDENCIES: [what this task depends on]
DELIVERABLES: [expected outputs]
PRIORITY: [high/medium/low]
```

## Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol

The Agent Lead coordinates all specialized agents through:
- **Requirement Analysis**: Break down user requests into atomic, agent-specific tasks
- **Dependency Mapping**: Identify task relationships and execution order across agents
- **Parallel Coordination**: Execute independent tasks simultaneously for maximum efficiency
- **Integration Management**: Coordinate handoffs between agents (Database â†’ Backend â†’ Frontend)
- **Quality Validation**: Ensure deliverables work together before proceeding to next phase
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor task completion across all agents with clear milestone indicators
